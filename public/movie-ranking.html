<h1>The Best Christmas Carol Movies</h1>
<hr>
<h3>A Christmas Carol - Patrick Stewart</h3>
<p>This is my favourite acted one.  I love Patrick Stewart's version of Scrooge.  <br>
    He has the right level of grumpiness.  I also love Richard E Grant as Bob.  He's believedly scared and timid of Scrooge.</p>
<h3>A Muppet's Christmas Carol</h3>
<p>The songs are great and it's lots of fun.  I also like Michael Caine's Scooge.</p>
<h3>A Christmas Carol - Kelsey Grammer's Version</h3>
<p>I like the songs - especially Link by Link</p>
<p>Link by link,<br>
    my chain was getting longer! <br>
    Link by link, <br>
    I should've heard a clink! <br>
    Link by link, <br>
    each year a little stronger. <br>
